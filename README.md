# Holberton School C# Project

## About the Developer
I'm Arnaud Tily, a passionate developer with a strong interest in C# programming. You can find more about me on my portfolio projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/Albaryys/Esperia).

## Description
This repository contains a collection of C# exercises completed as part of a school project. These exercises cover various fundamental concepts of C# programming, ranging from basic syntax to more advanced topics like object-oriented programming and data structures.

Each exercise is designed to reinforce specific skills and understanding of C# programming. The exercises are organized into separate folders, each focusing on a different aspect of C# development. The project structure is well-organized, making it easy to navigate through the exercises and find the relevant code files.

Some of the exercises included in this project are:
- **Hello World**: A simple introductory program to get started with C#.
- **Calculator**: Implementation of a basic calculator application using C# methods and operators.
- **Data Structures**: Exercises demonstrating the implementation of common data structures such as arrays, lists, and dictionaries in C#.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Practice with classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in C#.

Each exercise includes detailed comments explaining the purpose of the code and providing insights into the underlying concepts. Additionally, test cases are provided to validate the correctness of the implemented solutions.

Whether you're a beginner looking to learn C# or an experienced developer brushing up on your skills, this project provides a valuable resource for practicing and mastering C# programming.

Feel free to explore the exercises, contribute improvements, or use them as a reference for your own C# projects!
